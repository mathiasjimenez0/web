Welcome to my website. Here you can find all my research and non-research projects, professional information, and links to social media. Feel free to navigate, share, and contact me by any means provided here.

During my Ph.D., I have done theoretical and empirical research on the extent to which banks are technologically obsolete in the provision of payment services, the historical evolution of the modern banking industry, and the extent of financial fragility in unregulated banking.
