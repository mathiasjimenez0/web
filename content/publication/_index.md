[Are Banks Technologically Obsolete? A New Monetarist Approach](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhg6f0c7hatjsyn/banks_obsolete.pdf?dl=0).
*Jimenez (2020, working paper)*

{{< spoiler text="*Abstract*" >}}
Given the current state of technology, which could allow agents to transfer directly Central Bank fiat money seamlessly and cheaply across the world, are we close to reaching a stage where private banks become "technologically obsolete"?. To provide some insights about this question, we build a monetary search model with several "imperfections" in the medium-of-exchange (MOE), such as asymmetric information in its value, imperfect supply elasticity, and transportation costs. Banks are "experts" in this MOE and have access to a payment infrastructure that can facilitate payments among non-banks by issuing transferable debt. Our model is specifically designed to account for historical evidence on banking origins, innovations, and also to speculate about its future. We first show what we call the "Two Worlds" result, which allows us to partition the parameter space into two sub-spaces that speak to the relevance of banking in the competitive equilibrium. Our main result suggests that we might not be far away from private banks becoming obsolete technologically speaking. Formally, suppose we start from a parameterized model consistent with being in a "Banking World". Then, even if the payment infrastructure endowed to banks is as good as it can get, agents in equilibrium strictly prefer to use only the MOE for payments when asymmetric information frictions and transportation costs vanish.

The Extent of Financial Fragility in Unregulated Banking Systems: Evidence from Canada, 1871-1913.
*Jimenez (2021, work in progress)*

{{< spoiler text="*Abstract*" >}}
This paper challenges the conventional view that unregulated banking systems are "robust-but-fragile", where banks provide valuable services during normal times but are also susceptible to a systemic run under financial stress. We use novel and granular data for Canada from 1871 to 1913, a period where there was no Central Bank, no currency monopoly, no deposit insurance, no explicit nor implicit bailout guarantees, no liquidity requirements, no mandatory public audits or inspections, and no public resolution authority. In this context, we show, among other things: i) The system evolved towards a handful of cooperative and well-diversified large banks, with no need for correspondent relationships. ii) Banks self-organized under an association that implemented centralized daily net clearing and settlement, liquidity management oversight, and rules for crises management and resolution. Moreover, the largest banks acted as ad-hoc central bankers by being lenders of last resort and making assume-and-purchase agreements with others at the brink of failure. iii) There were no system-wide runs even though their principal trading and financial partners (the US and UK) did have several. However, the system experienced some localized financial distress, and several bank failures were accompanied by fraud from top executives to both shareholders and creditors. The paper suggests that more work needs to be done in modern quantitative banking models to disentangle purely decentralized mechanisms from policy-induced microstructure. It also underscores the complexities in modeling and doing counterfactuals on path-dependent systems.

The Life-Cycle of Banking.
*Jimenez (2021, work in progress)*

{{< spoiler text="*Abstract*" >}}
This paper is the first to document the evolution of a banking system from the appearance of its first bank to maturity in terms of stable turnover dynamics. Specifically, we rely on multiple new historical sources for Canada from 1817 (when the Bank of Montreal was chartered) to 1931 (when the industry stabilized to just five large banks). These novel sources allow us to show the life-cycle of the competitive structure, branching expansion, portfolio choices, capital structure, financial network, turnover dynamics, and their interaction with trade routes, population settlement, economic development, and international financial crises.
