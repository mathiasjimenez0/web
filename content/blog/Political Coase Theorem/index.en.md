One of the most relevant themes in political economy is the asymmetrical relationship between those who do, and those who do not have *de facto* political power, usually meaning that they are endowed with a better military technology. This relationship can take the form of a powerful group who enslaves the rest, a landlord with serfs, an authoritarian dynasty, or even a democracy. 

The literature has claimed this asymmetry implies an inherent commitment problem: if the political elite is the only group who has enough force to enforce and change rules over ownership, use and transfer of resources then they cannot credibly promise to comply with a contract between them and the rest of society.

A lot has been done to understand how societies can re-balance this relationship. While there is a consensus that having strong check and balances both by having elections or by limiting legal capabilities while in power, if these are established at the very beginning, there is nothing that guarantees their implementation since elites have to agree to change the contract between them and the rest. Moreover, even if there are checks, this certainly does not solves the problem if elites are somewhat coordinated and have *de facto* discretion over changing these rules ex-post. 

Another possible avenue for re-balancing this asymmetry is to try to change the political system or more broadly the industry for political systems, which in principle could be done either by using direct democracy tools such as referendums, or by revolting. The evidence says that usually just using tools provided by the ones who hold power is not enough to radically change the political system. On the other hand, revolutions, revolts, or riots can be more effective but, by assumption, the elite is the group who has relatively more power over military technologies and resources. 

As with any industry, managerial decisions and innovation tend to be aligned with customer preferences whenever these and not managers have more power, which translates into the latter feeling a constant pressure from customers to provide better services. The essence of this force comes from customers being able to unilaterally choose to switch over providers. As mentioned, elections, referendums, and riots are weak instruments of pressure for elites to enact good policies.

Non-elites can also try to switch providers by either moving to another territory or by trying to secede from the governing elite to create a distinct political system. However, there are both technological and artificial costs. Technological moving costs are associated with transportation costs, psychological costs and uncertainty, while artificial moving costs are associated with immigration policy. As for secession, technological costs can be summarized as a collective action problem about the execution of secession itself and posterior structure of the new jurisdiction, and artificial costs are the ones dictated by the actual political system to impede secession. Therefore, artificial switching costs are associated with how elites choose policies and design the political system to affect the relationship between its jurisdiction and the industry as a whole. 

One implication from this analysis seems to be that the most effective and sustainable way to change policies for good is by affecting variables outside the reach of political control by either lowering technological switching costs like transportation costs or barriers to enter the political industry like the technical feasibility of floating political jurisdictions in international waters, or the design of a permisionless and censorship resistant online protocol where agents can move their economic activity to.
