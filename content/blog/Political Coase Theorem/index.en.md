One of the most relevant themes in political economy is the asymmetrical relationship between those who do and those who do not have *de facto* political power, usually meaning that they are endowed with better military technology. This relationship can take the form of a powerful group that enslaves the rest, a landlord with serfs, an authoritarian dynasty, or even a democracy. 

The literature has claimed this asymmetry implies an inherent commitment problem. For example, suppose the political elite is the only group with enough force to enforce and change rules over ownership, use, and transfer of resources. In that case, they cannot credibly promise to comply with a contract between them and the rest of society.

There is some consensus that having elections and strong checks and balances while in power helps induce good policies. However, nothing guarantees the implementation of these mechanisms in the first place, nor their maintenance over time, especially if elites are somewhat coordinated and have *de facto* discretion over changing these rules ex-post. 

Another possible avenue for re-balancing this asymmetry is to change the political system more directly or, more broadly, the industry for political systems. For example, this could be attempted by using direct democracy tools such as referendums or revolting. However, usually just using tools provided by those who hold power is not enough to radically change a political system. Moreover, revolutions, revolts, or riots can be more effective, but, by assumption, the political elite is the group that has relatively more power over military technologies and resources. 

As with any industry, managerial decisions and innovations tend to be aligned with customer preferences whenever customers and not managers have more power, which translates into the latter feeling constant pressure from customers to provide better services. The essence of this force comes from customers being able to choose to switch over providers unilaterally. As mentioned, elections, referendums, and riots are weak pressure instruments for elites to enact good policies.

Citizen customers can also try to switch providers by either moving to another territory or by trying to secede from the governing elite to create a different political system. However, there are both technological and artificial costs for attempting these. Technological moving costs are associated with transportation costs, psychological costs, and uncertainty from moving outcomes. In contrast, artificial moving costs are associated with immigration policies. As for secession, technological costs can be summarized as a collective action problem about the execution of secession itself and the posterior structure of the new jurisdiction. On the other hand, artificial costs are the rules embedded in the existing political system to out frictions on secession. Therefore, artificial switching costs for moving and seceding are associated with how elites choose policies and design the political system to affect the relationship between its jurisdiction and the political industry. 

One implication from this analysis seems to be that the most effective and sustainable way to change policies for good is by affecting variables outside the reach of political control, like lowering transportation costs, the uncertainty from moving, or the barriers to entering the political industry. A couple of prominent examples are floating political jurisdictions in international waters or a permissionless and censorship-resistant online protocol to which agents can move their economic activity.
